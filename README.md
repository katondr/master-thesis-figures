# Master Thesis Figures

## Background
In molecular biology, many information present in the form of sequences.
Proper vizualitation may provide better insight in problem solving.
Therefore, preparing genetic map, peptide sequence, alignment became a routine.
Unfortunately this is also a challange,
because many student end up spending a lot of time in revising figure.

This page was prepared as a reference for molecular biology student,
who interested in alternative way to produce a high quality figure.
The purpose inf this page is educational.

The material was prepared as Python script,
and student can use the script to
generate file in PNG format.

## How to
Student can download content of this directory through this
